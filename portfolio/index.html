            <p>Hello! I'm a 14-year-old student currently attending a public school in Hyderabad.<br>
                I'm currently in the 10th grade, and I'm passionate about programming. I enjoy diving into the world of web development and have gained proficiency in several programming languages and technologies.<br><br>
                
                One of my main interests is coding websites. I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the fundamental building blocks of web development. These languages allow me to create visually appealing and interactive websites that cater to various user needs. Whether it's designing elegant layouts, crafting responsive designs, or adding interactive features, I love the creative process of web development.<br><br>
                
                Additionally, I'm also familiar with C++, a versatile and powerful programming language. It allows me to work on a wide range of projects, from desktop applications to game development. I find the problem-solving aspect of programming intriguing, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skills.<br><br>
                
                In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming concepts and technologies, as well as working on personal coding projects to enhance my skills further. I'm excited about the endless possibilities that the world of programming offers and look forward to pursuing a successful career in this field.<br><br>
                
                Feel free to connect with me if you share a passion for coding or want to collaborate on exciting projects!
